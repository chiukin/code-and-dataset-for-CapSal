# Code-and-Dataset-for-CapSal
   This project provides the code and datasets for 'CapSal: Leveraging Captioning to Boost Semantics for Salient Object Detection', CVPR 2019. [Paper link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JcZMHBXEX-7AR1P010OXg_wCCC5HukeZ)
    
   The Training code and dataset is coming soon.
   Our code is implemented based on the Mask RCNN in Tensorflow and Keras. You can first install the maskrcnn according to the [instruction](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN.git) or `INSTALL.md`.
